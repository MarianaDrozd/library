A Library from MDN tutorial improved by me :)

- clone the project;
- create & activate virtual environment;
- rename '.env.example' to '.env'
- run `pip install -r requirements.txt`;
- run migrations:
- - `python manage.py makemigrations`;
- - `python manage.py migrate`;
- run `python manage.py runserver`.
